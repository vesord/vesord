Main goal: create a program which could perform server-server and client-server interactions within the IRC-network (), using ony C++, STL, algorithm and cryptographic libraries.

## SOFT SKILLS

In university I was in charge of faculty and then university student council. 
Also worked in department of Higher Mathematics in my university. 
And was in charge of department of Informal education in youth non-profit organization (Russian Union of Youth, Kamchatka department).

Main soft skills developed:
- goal orientation,
- project management,
- public speaking,
- time management,
- team leading.

## OVERALL

I am open to all the opportunities where I can apply my current skills and learn more. I am ready to make an effort to study new technologies in computer graphics and improve the existing knowledge. 

CG is very beautiful, modern and cool ;)
